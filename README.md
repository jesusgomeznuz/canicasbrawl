# CanicasBrawl

## Introduction
**CanicasBrawl** is a Unity-based project that combines simulation mechanics, music, and visual storytelling. The primary goal is to provide a unique and exciting experience through interactions with marbles, songs, and iconic characters. Additionally, the project integrates **Python automation scripts** to optimize content generation, from videos to detailed statistics.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key folders and files:

- **canciones/**: Contains the songs used in the project, including separated vocal and instrumental tracks.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for automation.
- **raw production/**: Stores intermediate materials generated during content creation, such as unedited videos.
- **runs/**: Folder containing data and videos for each run.
- **CanicasBrawl/**: Unity project folder with essential images, scripts, and assets.
- **historico_runs.xlsx**: File that logs the historical data of all previous runs.
- **prompt1.txt**: File with prompts used for automation assistance.

## How the Project Works

### Overview
The core of the project is the main script, `generate-videos.py`, which connects and manages the different elements needed to produce **CanicasBrawl** videos. 

### 1. `generate-videos.py`
- **Purpose**: Combines run video (from `run_folder`) and voice files (from `canciones`) to produce final CanicasBrawl videos.
- **Automates the process of**:
  - Verifying if a video has already been produced.
  - Checking for missing character voice files.
  - Generating missing voices using integrated voice services ([Jammable](https://www.jammable.com/), [Applio](https://applio.org/), or [AICoverGen](https://huggingface.co/spaces/r3gm/AICoverGen)).
  - Cutting and joining audio tracks based on lead times from `winner_log.csv`.
  - Synchronizing the audio with the race video.
- **Output**: A fully synchronized video file ready for final distribution.

This process is supported by two fundamental subprocesses:

### 1. `guardar_run.py`
- **Purpose**: Creates consecutive `run_folder` and moves the most recent recording (from Unity) into it.
- **Automates the process of**:
  - Creating the `run_folder` and organizing its contents.
  - Moving the most recent recording (run video) to the folder.
  - Moving `winner_log.csv` from the source directory to the `run_folder`.
  - Ensuring all necessary logs (`winner_log.csv`, `results.csv`, and `winner.csv`) are correctly organized for further processing.
- **Output**: A structured folder containing:
  - The run video.
  - `winner_log.csv`, `results.csv` (for lead times), and `winner.csv`.
- **Importance**: This script sets up the required files for further analysis and video generation.

2. **`voice-removal.py`**:
   - Takes as input the name, YouTube link, and start time of a song to:
     - Download a 1-minute segment.
     - Separate vocal and instrumental tracks.
   - **Note**: This process requires manual intervention due to platform limitations that detect Selenium as a bot.

These three scripts (along with `generate-videos.py`) form **the backbone of the project**, transforming data and songs into engaging visual content.
