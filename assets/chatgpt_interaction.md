## User's Prompt

Hello! I’m working on a game called Canicas Brawl, which involves assigning players to marbles that compete in a race. Whenever a marble takes the lead, I use the assigned character's voice model to sing a song using AI. In other words, the marbles sing a specific song, and the leading character always sings. I achieve this with Unity by generating a .csv file that records leadership changes to help me edit the audio. I also have a .csv file that logs the total time each marble sings, which helps me adjust their positions based on my goals.

In this ocasion, I want to create a 1vs1 race, where 8 marbles will compete. My goal is to substitute the original marbles while meeting the following criteria:

1. The total singing time should be approximately equal. (High Priority)
2. The distribution of marbles should be 4:4. (High Priority)
3. There should be frequent leadership changes, ensuring that both marbles not only sing for the same amount of time but also alternate singing constantly. (High Priority)
4. The marble that sings the least amount of time should win. (Low Priority)

I’m sharing the current positions, my winner logs, and the total singing time for each table. It's important to note that there are 8 marbles, and all are assigned to a player. You need to tell me which marbles I should substitute for the original players to achieve the desired 1v1 effect.

In total, there are 8 players. If one doesn’t appear, assume they didn’t sing and assign them anyway.
